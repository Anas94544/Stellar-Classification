# Stellar-Classification
In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and guide key decisions. I handled outliers, applied feature engineering, and extracted meaningful features to improve model performance. To deal with high dimensionality, I used dimensionality reduction techniques. Leveraging my programming skills, I built and evaluated four machine learning models: XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN. After comparison, the best-performing model was selected to deliver accurate star and galaxy classification.
