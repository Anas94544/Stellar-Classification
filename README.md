# Stellar-Classification
n this project, I performed data analysis, handled outliers, and applied feature engineering. I used dimensionality reduction techniques and built four machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN). After comparison, the best-performing model was selected for accurate star and galaxy classification.
